Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative Filtering simply put uses the "wisdom of the crowd" to recommend items.
Item based collaborative filtering uses the patterns of users who liked the same movie as me to recommend me a movie (users who liked the movie that I like, also liked these other movies).
Recommendation based on user's input of any movie present in the dataset.
